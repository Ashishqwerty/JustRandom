Hi Homosapiens,
This is Ashish Bajpayee from the worlds biggest democracy India.
i have a passion for computer programming and languages like JAVA is my favourite but unfortunately or my bad "KISMAT" which means luck or fate in Hindi i ended up doing a Btech Biotechnology degree. But now i know i didnt have to have a computer science degree to become a software engineer or develop applications.
My dream is to work for Google  one day and I WILL...eventually.
Thank you.
